**Worldaria** is the geographical game to learn countries and regions of our planet. There are 6 modes to try:

* **Game:** you have 5 attempts to guess each suggested country. Each right answer will give you 1 point. After 5 wrong attempts you will lose 1 point. You can save your current game result anytime just quiting it if you are guessing by **name**.
* **Online:** you will play with real person one by one. Each player has 15 seconds to guess the country. After 5 wrong attempts you will not lose points. **To play this mode you should sign in**.
* **Bot:** you will play with the bot, whose difficulty you can choose. You have 15 seconds to guess the country.
* **Learn:** you have unlimited attempts to guess the country. After 5 wrong attempts the right country will be accentuated. You can use search bar to find the right country.
* **Details:** you can learn additional information (area, population, etc.) about countries just clicking on them.
* **History:** you can learn historical countries of different periods.
